API Features and Filtering Options

    - Extend the filtering functionality to include more search options.
    - We could also use tools like Elasticsearch or Algolia for faster, more advanced search capabilities.
    - We could also use one of Laravel great tools, Laravel Scout to achieve full-text search on our models.

Improved Security and Authentication

    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Expand the authentication system to allow role-based access, where specific users can have different levels of access.
        In Laravel we achieve such purpose using Guards. For ease-of-use, we could for example use the spatie/laravel-permission third party library.
    - Implement OAuth2 and JWT tokens for better security in handling third-party integrations.

Testing

    - Increase unit and feature tests, especially for special cases and possible error scenarios.

Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling

    - Implement a logging system (e.g. Sentry) to track and visualize application logs and errors.
    - We could make further improvements on exception handling and also add more exception cases.

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

    - Refine the existing value objects and add more depending on the new concepts introduced in the project.
    - Separate domain logic from application logic even more by creating intermediary classes to handle data transformations between the application and domain layers.

Infrastructure

    - Index commonly queried fields(e.g. name, surname, date_of_birth) to improve query performance and achieve database optimization.

Deployment

    - We could use CI/CD tools (pipelines, jobs etc. if using GitLab) in order to achieve automatic deployment for specific scenarios..

Documentation

    - Document each component of the application thoroughly, especially the domain layer, to ensure the team understands the business logic.
    - Use a documentation library for the API documentation(e.g. Swagger) so the front-end team has every detail they need to utilize every endpoint correctly.
